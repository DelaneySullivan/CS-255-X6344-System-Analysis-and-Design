# CS-255-X6344-System-Analysis-and-Design


Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
Our client is DriverPass. The purpose of this project is to design a cloud web based system that will provide students with better driver training so they are prepared for the DMV drivers test. The client would like the system to be able to give students access to online classes, practice exams and book in person on-the-road training.


What did you do particularly well?
I believe that I did the business requirement document particular well. This is because I really did my best to ensure that all the requirements were taken down from the interview and translated onto the document. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would say that I would revise some of the models I made. I feel that I could have done a nicer job on them and made them colorful.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I implemented the user's needs by taking all the requirements from the client and making models of each system with those requirements. It's important to consider the user's needs when designing so ensure that the user has the best experience with the program. Also, it is important because it will satisfy the client as well.


How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I would approach designing software by creating models for the system. Whether it is a class diagram, sequence diagram etc. All these strategies are useful when creating a system in the future.
